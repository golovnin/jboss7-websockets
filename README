An modified example from Jetty project, which shows how you can add WebSockets
support to an application in JBoss 7.

Run "ant dist" to create the WAR file. The WAR file can be found in the dist
directory. Copy the WAR file into the "standalone/deployments" folder of your
JBoss 7 installation.

The test application should be now accessible on http://localhost:8181/test.
